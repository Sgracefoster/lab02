# Lab 02 -- Chapter 01

## Define the followint terms:
* object, an instance of a class
* class, a template for classes
* instance, each time a program runs
* method, the way we communicate with an object
* signature, the method name and the parameters types of a method
* parameter, controls the extent of an action
* type, classification of data
* state, where all the information is stored during an instance
* source code, determines behaviors and structures of objects
* return value, what the int return to after the program runs
* compiler transform it into something the computer can understand

## In Chapter 1 we have mentioned the data types int and String. Java has more predefined data types. Find out what they are and what they are used for. To do this, you can check Appendix B, or look it up in another Java book or in an online Java language manual. One such manual is at [http://download.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/nutsandbolts/datatypes.html](http://download.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/nutsandbolts/datatypes.html)

## What are the types of the following values?

* 0 int
* "hello" string
* 101 int
* -1 int
* true boolean
* "33" string
* 3.1415 int

## What would you have to do to add a new field, for example one called name, to a circle object?
circle.circleName(steve)
## Write the header for a method named send that has one parameter of type String, and does not return a value.
Void
## Write the header for a method named average that has two parameters, both of type int, and returns an int value.
public
## Look at the book you are reading right now. Is it an object or a class? If it is a class, name some objects. If it is an object, name its class.
class books
## Can an object have several different classes? Discuss.
Yes, because for example science book is class but then book is a class above it
